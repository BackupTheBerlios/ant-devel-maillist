<PRE>* Achim Blumensath &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ant-devel">blumensath at mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de</A>&gt; [2008-02-29 14:22:02+0100]
&gt;<i> &gt; Would you consider applying as a mentor for Google Summer of Code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programme[1]? This would give you developers who devote (at least)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their summer holidays to ant development. Particularly, I will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happy to work on ant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could act as a mentor for GSoC, but only as part of some other
</I>&gt;<i> project. I won't submit an &quot;ant project&quot; since I don't think such a
</I>&gt;<i> project would have much chance of being accepted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if there is some TeX related project willing to include work on ant,
</I>&gt;<i> I would volunteer as a mentor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Supposing that there is such a project, which part of ant would you be
</I>&gt;<i> interested in working on?
</I>
First of all, you know ant far better than me, so if you see some things
that need to be done and you have not enough time for them, I'd be happy
to help.

What I'd like to achieve is easy process of migration from LaTeX to ant.
There have to be analogs for all popular LaTeX and amsTeX classes and
styles. Also we need i18n -- tool for converting LaTeX encoding and
hyphenation files to ant would be great (does it already exist?).
