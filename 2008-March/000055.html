<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. unicode &lt;-&gt; character conversion function
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> were just added to CVS.
</I>
I'll check out from CVS and try it. Thank you very much. I hope by  
doing a diff I can learn how to code ps_log_string myself.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. ps_log_string that writes to the log file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean like ps_warning, just without the text &quot;WARNING&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> I can do that.
</I>Yes.



&gt;&gt;<i> 4. \ifdef and it's ps_xxxx equivalence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can add a ps_if_defined, but I won't add any conditionals to the
</I>&gt;<i> markup language. Everything requiring them should be implemented in  
</I>&gt;<i> AL.
</I>Yes that makes perfect sense.


&gt;&gt;<i> 5. ps_xxxx equivalents to \setparameter{} and \setmathfont{}. I can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> figure out how to use set_math_font which returns a function of type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment. May be it should be used to construct nodes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those were planned for a long time, but I didn't find the time.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, you can use
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ps_set_par_params dict ps :=
</I>&gt;<i>    ps_add_node (Command, set_par_params dict) ps;
</I>Thanks. It should be good enough for the time being.


&gt;&gt;<i> 6. helper functions to construct nodes. I saw a (commented out)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example of using ps_add_node.  Node.ml seem to contain most of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> definitions, but I am not exactly sure how to do the translation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can take a look at Markup/ALNodes.ml for the coding. Anyway, I  
</I>&gt;<i> plan
</I>&gt;<i> to add AL commands for all markup commands (like hbox, vbox, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> So in most cases it should become unnecessary to construct nodes  
</I>&gt;<i> directly.
</I>I will try.


&gt;&gt;<i> 7. I would prefer math_char definition local to the current group.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually I wonder why macros are made global.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would you need local definitions? I have a hard time imagining  
</I>&gt;<i> cases
</I>&gt;<i> where local definitions of macros are useful.
</I>Maybe I just need some more time to get used to it.

&gt;&gt;<i> 8. Named float queues. When I define a float area, I specify a queue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name (similar to Galley). When I place a float, I also specify the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name of float queue to which the current float is appended. I hope to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use this feature to implement multi-column figure/equation, and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> floats
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in margin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is your question? Float areas already have a name. Support for
</I>&gt;<i> margin notes is planned. I just didn't get around to implementing them
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>
I was thinking of this:

ps_new_area &quot;float&quot; ...... {Name := &quot;TwoColumnFloat&quot; | ...};
ps_new_area &quot;float&quot; ...... {Name := &quot;SingleColumnFloat&quot; | ...};  ;;  
for left column
ps_new_area &quot;float&quot; ...... {Name := &quot;SingleColumnFloat&quot; | ...};  ;;  
for right column
...
\floatbox{TwoColumnFloat}{ \hbox{Figure1} }
\floatbox{SingleColumnFloat}{ \hbox{Figure2} }
\floatbox{TwoColumnFloat}{ \hbox{Figure3} }
\floatbox{SingleColumnFloat}{ \hbox{Figure4} }

In this way, Single-column figures and double-column figures can co- 
exist in one page, and the double-column ones have higher priority.
----

On the other hand, if I do this:
ps_new_area &quot;float&quot; ...... { ...};  ;; for left column
ps_new_area &quot;float&quot; ...... { ...};  ;; for right column
ps_new_area &quot;float&quot; ...... { ...};  ;; double column

Single column figures will occupy the best position (top of the left  
column) first, leaving double column figures at awkward positions.


&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't read much Ant source code yet. I haven't used functional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programming language before, so my code reading is slow. Writing AL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts was a pain at first, but I think I am slowly picking up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some of the items in the wish list may not be necessary, or better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternatives are available. Refernece.ant and manual.sty has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enormously helpful to my macro writing so far. I certainly hope to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more examples, if possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any concrete suggestions of how to improve the manual I
</I>&gt;<i> would be grateful.
</I>
A complete manual is a huge task for a single person, but the Ant  
community is too small...

When I mentioned Ant to my friends, there are always three reasons  
that prevents them from investigating further:
1. No macro package for users. That's what I started working on,  
though it will only be a tiny one compared to LaTeX/ConTeXt.
2. Much fewer programmers know OCaml or other functional language.  
This makes the learning curve steeper. It requires more motivation for  
people to take the steep learning curve. Luatex, in comparison, is  
much easier to learn, and has a much larger community.
A Gallery demonstrating the capabilities of Ant would help attract  
people to learn Ant, hopefully.

Right now I just want to focus on the small macro package for maths,  
while learning more about Ant.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried loading a Chinese TTF font in ant. Correct result was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generated, but it takes two minutes or so to load the font (on core 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duo). I wonder if this would be a fundamental limitation to ant, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is definite solutions to this problem. I don't need Chinese
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> typesetting at this moment, but it's definitely something we need in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How many glyphs did this font contain? I'm using ant with the  
</I>&gt;<i> MinionPro
</I>&gt;<i> font which has about 1500 glyphs and I didn't notice any slowdown.
</I>&gt;<i> Can you you point me to some free Chinese font where the problem  
</I>&gt;<i> occurs?
</I>
I was using the Chinese font ( STSong ) coming with Mac OS X. I don't  
have the count of glyphs, but it's certainly more than 20,000. If you  
don't have this font I can try some GPL/APL fonts from the following  
website:
<A HREF="http://www.unifont.org/fontguide/">http://www.unifont.org/fontguide/</A>


----------
Further, I was trying to implement matrix in mathmode. I realize that  
there is no equivalents to \setbox. I can't read and set the dimension  
of boxes either. Vertically centering a matrix seems impossible now.
BTW, would you recommend to implement matrix with a table?

Thank you very much.


regards,
ShenChen
