<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 1. unicode &lt;-&gt; character conversion function
</I>
were just added to CVS.

&gt;<i> 2. ps_log_string that writes to the log file.
</I>
You mean like ps_warning, just without the text &quot;WARNING&quot;?
I can do that.

&gt;<i> 3. kpsewhich function: I dump various maps (font encodings, etc) with  
</I>&gt;<i> serialization, and certainly hope to place them in my TEXMF tree.
</I>
I'll add those.

&gt;<i> 4. \ifdef and it's ps_xxxx equivalence.
</I>
I can add a ps_if_defined, but I won't add any conditionals to the
markup language. Everything requiring them should be implemented in AL.

&gt;<i> 5. ps_xxxx equivalents to \setparameter{} and \setmathfont{}. I can't  
</I>&gt;<i> figure out how to use set_math_font which returns a function of type  
</I>&gt;<i> environment. May be it should be used to construct nodes?
</I>
Those were planned for a long time, but I didn't find the time.
Currently, you can use

  ps_set_par_params dict ps :=
    ps_add_node (Command, set_par_params dict) ps;

&gt;<i> 6. helper functions to construct nodes. I saw a (commented out)  
</I>&gt;<i> example of using ps_add_node.  Node.ml seem to contain most of the  
</I>&gt;<i> definitions, but I am not exactly sure how to do the translation.
</I>
You can take a look at Markup/ALNodes.ml for the coding. Anyway, I plan
to add AL commands for all markup commands (like hbox, vbox, etc.)
So in most cases it should become unnecessary to construct nodes directly.

&gt;<i> 7. I would prefer math_char definition local to the current group.  
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I wonder why macros are made global.
</I>
Why would you need local definitions? I have a hard time imagining cases
where local definitions of macros are useful.

&gt;<i> 8. Named float queues. When I define a float area, I specify a queue  
</I>&gt;<i> name (similar to Galley). When I place a float, I also specify the  
</I>&gt;<i> name of float queue to which the current float is appended. I hope to  
</I>&gt;<i> use this feature to implement multi-column figure/equation, and floats  
</I>&gt;<i> in margin.
</I>
What is your question? Float areas already have a name. Support for
margin notes is planned. I just didn't get around to implementing them
yet.

&gt;<i> I haven't read much Ant source code yet. I haven't used functional  
</I>&gt;<i> programming language before, so my code reading is slow. Writing AL  
</I>&gt;<i> scripts was a pain at first, but I think I am slowly picking up.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the items in the wish list may not be necessary, or better  
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives are available. Refernece.ant and manual.sty has been  
</I>&gt;<i> enormously helpful to my macro writing so far. I certainly hope to see  
</I>&gt;<i> more examples, if possible.
</I>
If you have any concrete suggestions of how to improve the manual I
would be grateful.

&gt;<i> I tried loading a Chinese TTF font in ant. Correct result was  
</I>&gt;<i> generated, but it takes two minutes or so to load the font (on core 2  
</I>&gt;<i> duo). I wonder if this would be a fundamental limitation to ant, or  
</I>&gt;<i> there is definite solutions to this problem. I don't need Chinese  
</I>&gt;<i> typesetting at this moment, but it's definitely something we need in  
</I>&gt;<i> future.
</I>
How many glyphs did this font contain? I'm using ant with the MinionPro
font which has about 1500 glyphs and I didn't notice any slowdown.
Can you you point me to some free Chinese font where the problem occurs?
