Hi,

First of all, huge thanks to Achim and other Ant developers! I haven't
used it much yet, but from I see it has huge potential. It is a dream
come true to finally be able to raise over the clumsiness and
limitations of TeX which have been torturing us for decades, and at
the same time to not lose the best things that TeX pioneered, such as
paragraph-at-once optimal linebreaking. The simple and intuitive idea
of pageareas and galleys (similar to XSL-FO) is especially nice.

However, there are several things that I still don't understand how to
do even after reading the manual, or that I understand to be
impossible currently and would like to inquire as to whether they are
being worked on and how I could help to implement them.

1. Getting rid of the fixed width of galleys - and more generally,
typesetting the galley material not before it is cut into areas but
after that. Also, being able to use pageareas of different width and
non-rectangular ones in any mix for a single galley. From the archived
discussions on this list I get that this is not yet possible, but is
planned. I think this is one of the most disappointing vestiges of the
TeX model that Ant has to break in order to become an all-powerful
typesetter.

2. Probably related to the previous point, in some books and
magazines, the first line of the first paragraph of a chapter is often
set in a different font. I can't do that automatically in TeX; is this
possible in Ant by some trick? Ideally I want to be able to set each
line of a paragraph, counting from top or from bottom, in a different
font.

3. Marginal notes that cut into the main text - i.e. indent into e.g.
3 lines at this height

4. A way to insert inline notes, such as "(continied)", into the text
flow right after a page break or pagearea break

5. A way to specify parshape counting from bottom, as already
discussed on this list - it was suggested that it's possible via some
AL trickery with double processing, but I could not figure this out -
can anyone please give an example code?

Thanks for any suggestions!

This is currently not possible. It requires a major restructuring of the
layout algorithms.

This is not possible and I have no idea how such a feature could be
implemented (without making everything unbearable slow).

This should be possible with some scripting. Basically what you have to
do is to run ant once to get the line number where the note appears
and then to run it a second time to change the par-shape accordingly.

This is also currently not possible, but it could probably be added
after the rewrite of the galley code.

At the top of manual.ant there is a commented out section with some
scripting commands which might be helpful. There you can see how to
change the par-shape depending on the number of lines of the paragraph.

I understand that - but my question here is, is such restructuring in
the plans at all? Can I help it to happen, in any way? (I can code and
I know TeX, but have almost no knowledge of CAML or Haskell)

Well, if you have a command that returns the line number and
coordinates (from a previous run), why not add a command that would
return the start/end of the source text stream for each line number,
also from a previous run? If it would then allow to make a group for
this fragment and insert style command into it, the problem is solved
- after at most several runs it should converge and only that line
will be styled. It's just a vague idea of course - but do you think it
might work?

The only problem I see with this approach is the style of the hyphen
or the ff->f/ff type breaks if that styled line happens to end on a
word break. But then, the command might return not only start/end
boundaries of the line but its final text along with the line break
hyphen, and the script would then simply replace the source group with
this saved text, making sure it is all in the same style.

In general, why this fixation on speed? It won't take hours - or even
minutes - to produce a page no matter what, and anything less is
acceptable as a starting point for further optimization if necessary.
I think the first priority should be to make a program _correct_ and
_complete_, and only then think about speed. Look at TeX - on modern
hardware it's almost instantaneous, but what good is that, given its
numerous unfixable problems?

Thanks, I thought this should be the approach to use, but I couldn't
make it work. I will experiment some more.

Again, if you add commands to return the boundaries of not only lines
but also of pageareas in a galley, a command would then be able to
expand into "(continued)" at the start of each such group except
first.

Thanks, I will look into this.

It is planned. But development of ant is currently stopped due to lack
of time on my part. Of course, you could try to implement it yourself,
but it would require some familiarity with the internals of ant.

This would basically mean that I had to annotate every box with this
information. This would at least double the memory requirements. I could
do this, but I don't think it would solve your problem: How do you use
this information to insert the appropriate type-setting commands at the
correct place?

This information is not available anymore at typesetting time. When
ligatures and kerning is resolved all you have is a list of boxes.
There is no way to change the font, in particular, since the new font
might have different kinds of ligatures.

I'm afraid this is not true. Sophisticated page layout algorithms
actually do require something like a minute per page.

Not everything can be sped up by optimisation. If you have a
sophisticated algorithm there is just so much work you have to do that
you cannot simply avoid with some clever tricks. After all, optimal page
layout is an NP-hard problem.

Why did you get the impression that speed was the main concern for the
development of ant? After all, it is several orders of magnitude slower
than TeX.
