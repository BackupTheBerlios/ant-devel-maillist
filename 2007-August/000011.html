<PRE>Hello,

just in case somebody else has beginner's problems. Here is a small
file that creates a simple paragraph with the helvetica clone from urw:


\newpagelayout{pgpaper}{12cm}{8cm}
\newpagearea{bar}{10mm}{10mm}{18cm}{26cm}{10pt}{3pt}{galley}{ name = foo }
\include{fonts.ant}
\setparameter{font}{ family = Helvetica; series = medium; shape = normal }
\definecommand\FontFamilySans{Helvetica}
\sffamily
\setparameter{paragraph}{ par-indent = 15bp }
\newgalley{foo}{220bp}
\begingalley{foo}
In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose
daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that
the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it
shone in her face. Close by the king's castle lay a great dark
forest, and under an old lime-tree in the for est was a well, and
when the day was very warm, the king's child went out into the forest
and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she
was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught
it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.
\endgalley
\shipoutpages{pgpaper}{pgpaper}


and fonts.ant is the one from the manual with two lines added:

133:    hel  := &quot;Helvetica&quot;;
164:    ps_declare_font &quot;n019003l.pfb&quot;    hel  med  nor  ( 0, 20) { };


No idea if this is 'the way to go' or not, but it works.

Patrick
