Subject: [ant-devel] Esperanto hyphenation
Message-ID: <20081130021100.GA24914@crud.crud.mn.org>

A couple of years ago I adapted to ant the Esperanto hyphenation
patterns for TeX. I don't know how copyright and licensing affect
inclusion in ant, though the patterns could be provided in separate
packaging.

I've posted them here:
