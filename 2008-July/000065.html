<PRE>Hi,

First of all, huge thanks to Achim and other Ant developers! I haven't
used it much yet, but from I see it has huge potential. It is a dream
come true to finally be able to raise over the clumsiness and
limitations of TeX which have been torturing us for decades, and at
the same time to not lose the best things that TeX pioneered, such as
paragraph-at-once optimal linebreaking. The simple and intuitive idea
of pageareas and galleys (similar to XSL-FO) is especially nice.

However, there are several things that I still don't understand how to
do even after reading the manual, or that I understand to be
impossible currently and would like to inquire as to whether they are
being worked on and how I could help to implement them.

1. Getting rid of the fixed width of galleys - and more generally,
typesetting the galley material not before it is cut into areas but
after that. Also, being able to use pageareas of different width and
non-rectangular ones in any mix for a single galley. From the archived
discussions on this list I get that this is not yet possible, but is
planned. I think this is one of the most disappointing vestiges of the
TeX model that Ant has to break in order to become an all-powerful
typesetter.

2. Probably related to the previous point, in some books and
magazines, the first line of the first paragraph of a chapter is often
set in a different font. I can't do that automatically in TeX; is this
possible in Ant by some trick? Ideally I want to be able to set each
line of a paragraph, counting from top or from bottom, in a different
font.

3. Marginal notes that cut into the main text - i.e. indent into e.g.
3 lines at this height

4. A way to insert inline notes, such as &quot;(continied)&quot;, into the text
flow right after a page break or pagearea break

5. A way to specify parshape counting from bottom, as already
discussed on this list - it was suggested that it's possible via some
AL trickery with double processing, but I could not figure this out -
can anyone please give an example code?

Thanks for any suggestions!
