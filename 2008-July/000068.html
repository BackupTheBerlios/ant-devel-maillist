</I>
It is planned. But development of ant is currently stopped due to lack
of time on my part. Of course, you could try to implement it yourself,
but it would require some familiarity with the internals of ant.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2. Probably related to the previous point, in some books and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; magazines, the first line of the first paragraph of a chapter is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; often set in a different font. I can't do that automatically in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; TeX; is this possible in Ant by some trick? Ideally I want to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; able to set each line of a paragraph, counting from top or from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bottom, in a different font.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is not possible and I have no idea how such a feature could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented (without making everything unbearable slow).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if you have a command that returns the line number and
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates (from a previous run), why not add a command that would
</I>&gt;<i> return the start/end of the source text stream for each line number,
</I>&gt;<i> also from a previous run? If it would then allow to make a group for
</I>&gt;<i> this fragment and insert style command into it, the problem is solved
</I>&gt;<i> - after at most several runs it should converge and only that line
</I>&gt;<i> will be styled. It's just a vague idea of course - but do you think it
</I>&gt;<i> might work?
</I>
This would basically mean that I had to annotate every box with this
information. This would at least double the memory requirements. I could
do this, but I don't think it would solve your problem: How do you use
this information to insert the appropriate type-setting commands at the
correct place?

&gt;<i> The only problem I see with this approach is the style of the hyphen
</I>&gt;<i> or the ff-&gt;f/ff type breaks if that styled line happens to end on a
</I>&gt;<i> word break. But then, the command might return not only start/end
</I>&gt;<i> boundaries of the line but its final text along with the line break
</I>&gt;<i> hyphen, and the script would then simply replace the source group with
</I>&gt;<i> this saved text, making sure it is all in the same style.
</I>
This information is not available anymore at typesetting time. When
ligatures and kerning is resolved all you have is a list of boxes.
There is no way to change the font, in particular, since the new font
might have different kinds of ligatures.

&gt;<i> In general, why this fixation on speed? It won't take hours - or even
</I>&gt;<i> minutes - to produce a page no matter what,
</I>
I'm afraid this is not true. Sophisticated page layout algorithms
actually do require something like a minute per page.

&gt;<i> and anything less is acceptable as a starting point for further
</I>&gt;<i> optimization if necessary.
</I>
Not everything can be sped up by optimisation. If you have a
sophisticated algorithm there is just so much work you have to do that
you cannot simply avoid with some clever tricks. After all, optimal page
layout is an NP-hard problem.

&gt;<i> I think the first priority should be to make a program _correct_ and
</I>&gt;<i> _complete_, and only then think about speed. Look at TeX - on modern
</I>&gt;<i> hardware it's almost instantaneous, but what good is that, given its
</I>&gt;<i> numerous unfixable problems?
</I>
Why did you get the impression that speed was the main concern for the
development of ant? After all, it is several orders of magnitude slower
than TeX.
