&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Getting rid of the fixed width of galleys - and more generally,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after that. Also, being able to use pageareas of different width and

</I>&gt;<i> This is currently not possible. It requires a major restructuring of the

</I>
I understand that - but my question here is, is such restructuring in
the plans at all? Can I help it to happen, in any way? (I can code and
I know TeX, but have almost no knowledge of CAML or Haskell)

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Probably related to the previous point, in some books and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> magazines, the first line of the first paragraph of a chapter is often
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set in a different font. I can't do that automatically in TeX; is this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible in Ant by some trick? Ideally I want to be able to set each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line of a paragraph, counting from top or from bottom, in a different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> font.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not possible and I have no idea how such a feature could be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented (without making everything unbearable slow).
</I>
Well, if you have a command that returns the line number and
coordinates (from a previous run), why not add a command that would
return the start/end of the source text stream for each line number,
also from a previous run? If it would then allow to make a group for
this fragment and insert style command into it, the problem is solved
- after at most several runs it should converge and only that line
will be styled. It's just a vague idea of course - but do you think it
might work?

The only problem I see with this approach is the style of the hyphen
or the ff-&gt;f/ff type breaks if that styled line happens to end on a
word break. But then, the command might return not only start/end
boundaries of the line but its final text along with the line break
hyphen, and the script would then simply replace the source group with
this saved text, making sure it is all in the same style.

In general, why this fixation on speed? It won't take hours - or even
minutes - to produce a page no matter what, and anything less is
acceptable as a starting point for further optimization if necessary.
I think the first priority should be to make a program _correct_ and
_complete_, and only then think about speed. Look at TeX - on modern
hardware it's almost instantaneous, but what good is that, given its
numerous unfixable problems?

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Marginal notes that cut into the main text - i.e. indent into e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3 lines at this height
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This should be possible with some scripting. Basically what you have to
</I>&gt;<i> do is to run ant once to get the line number where the note appears
</I>&gt;<i> and then to run it a second time to change the par-shape accordingly.
</I>
Thanks, I thought this should be the approach to use, but I couldn't
make it work. I will experiment some more.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4. A way to insert inline notes, such as &quot;(continied)&quot;, into the text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flow right after a page break or pagearea break
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is also currently not possible, but it could probably be added
</I>&gt;<i> after the rewrite of the galley code.
</I>
Again, if you add commands to return the boundaries of not only lines
but also of pageareas in a galley, a command would then be able to
expand into &quot;(continued)&quot; at the start of each such group except
first.

&gt;&gt;<i> 5. A way to specify parshape counting from bottom, as already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussed on this list - it was suggested that it's possible via some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AL trickery with double processing, but I could not figure this out -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can anyone please give an example code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the top of manual.ant there is a commented out section with some
</I>&gt;<i> scripting commands which might be helpful. There you can see how to
</I>&gt;<i> change the par-shape depending on the number of lines of the paragraph.
</I>
Thanks, I will look into this.
