Hi,

could anybody send me an example 'hello world' file? I have gone
through the manual, but didn't succeed. I have found an older thread
on this, but that one was only about a small rule, I didn't succeed in
extending it.

Sorry for being so clueless,

Patrick

I'd be really happy for a small example to play with!

Message-ID: <m1ir7yjkc6.fsf@levana.de>

Hi,

I had success in creating a small 'hello world' file. But now I'd like
to get hello world with a type1 palatino to work. I've copied the font
file to the local directory, but which commands should I use to switch
to the right font?

Patrick

Hello,

just in case somebody else has beginner's problems. Here is a small
file that creates a simple paragraph with the helvetica clone from urw:


\newpagelayout{pgpaper}{12cm}{8cm}
\newpagearea{bar}{10mm}{10mm}{18cm}{26cm}{10pt}{3pt}{galley}{ name = foo }
\include{fonts.ant}
\setparameter{font}{ family = Helvetica; series = medium; shape = normal }
\definecommand\FontFamilySans{Helvetica}
\sffamily
\setparameter{paragraph}{ par-indent = 15bp }
\newgalley{foo}{220bp}
\begingalley{foo}
In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose
daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that
the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it
shone in her face. Close by the king's castle lay a great dark
forest, and under an old lime-tree in the for est was a well, and
when the day was very warm, the king's child went out into the forest
and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she
was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught
it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.
\endgalley
\shipoutpages{pgpaper}{pgpaper}


and fonts.ant is the one from the manual with two lines added:

133:    hel  := "Helvetica";
164:    ps_declare_font "n019003l.pfb"    hel  med  nor  ( 0, 20) { };


No idea if this is 'the way to go' or not, but it works.

You can omit these lines:

> \definecommand\FontFamilySans{Helvetica}
> \sffamily

The have the same effect as the \setparameter{font} command.

Yes, this looks fine. (Although you limit the size of the font to 20
points.) You could also insert the lines

  \ALcommand{
    ps_declare_font "n019003l.pfb" "Helvetica" "medium" "normal" (0,0) { }
  }

directly into your document.

Hello,

sorry for the late reply. I was on vacation.

Are you using version 0.7 or the current development version?

For the latter there is a minimal example in the Example directory.
I don't think it will work with version 0.7 though. Did you take a look
at the documents in the Example directory? newspaper.ant is rather
minimal (You probably need to change the fonts though since it uses
the GhostScript fonts).
