Subject: [ant-devel] ant and Camlimages 3.0.2
Message-ID: <20100602224117.GA28745@crud.chemoelectric.org>

There is a patch for compiling ant with Camlimages 3.0.2 at
http://bitbucket.org/chemoelectric/ant-devel/changeset/d910212c3e11/raw/ant-devel-d910212c3e11.diff
The biggest change is that there is a Bitmap module as part of
Camlimages, so I changed Runtime.Bitmap to Runtime.BitmapBase. I don't
know whether these particular changes ought to go into the CVS.

Different distributions seem to differ on whether they include
Camlimages 2 or Camlimages 3, so it is good to be able to use
either. I think unpatched Camlimages 2 may have some security issues,
but putting specially crafted trojan PNGs in your ant documents is a
bad idea, in any case. :)

Related: I'm trying to set up an ant mirror at Bitbucket, but am not
certain that I know what I am doing. :) My account is at
http://bitbucket.org/chemoelectric/

Less related: I have Exherbo Linux "packages" (exhereses) for ant and
its dependencies at http://github.com/chemoelectric/exherbo-rubujo
I'll be surprised if anyone else uses Exherbo. :) The packages could
easily be converted to Gentoo ebuilds, however, or used as guidance on
how to build ant manually.

Somehow I left out the renamed BitmapBase files. Here is a second
patch to be applied in addition to the previous one:

Looks good, except that I would prefer "MonoBitmap" instead of
"BitmapBase". If you don't beat me to it, I'll check in a corresponding
path as soon as I find the time.
