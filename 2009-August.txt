Subject: [ant-devel] Building camlimages-2.2 as Ant 0.8 prerequisite
Message-ID: <1251305654.3788.145.camel@pc118.cs.york.ac.uk>

Having built Ant 0.7 some time ago, and feeling I should really get back
to using Ant, I decided to build 0.8 - on Slackware Linux 12.1. The
prerequisite list from the README file is:

Package		Need:	I have:
OCaml		3.10	3.10.2
OMake		0.9.8.1	0.9.8.5
kpathsea	3.2	3.5.7
FreeType	2	2.3.5
CamlImages	2.2	  -
mlgmp (opt)	0.13	  -

I hoped that the slight variations in version number of the things I did
have were not important, but saw I was missing CamlImages. So, I set off
to build version 2.2. I saw:

> ...

> tiffread.c:69: error: ?photometric? undeclared (first use in this
> function)
> make[1]: *** [tiffread.o] Error 2

I googled for this error, and found some mention of it but no ideal
solution. This, the latest version of CamlImages, dates from as long ago
as 2004.

An ad hoc fix was to edit camlimages/tiff/tiffread.c:

31,34c31,34
< #undef int16
< #undef uint16
< #undef int32
< #undef uint32
---
> /*#undef int16	*/
> /*#undef uint16 */
> /*#undef int32	*/
> /*#undef uint32	*/

and then try the make again, but then I got:

> ...
> ?ocamlc.opt  -I ../corelib
> -I /usr/local/pkg/lablgtk-2.12.0-i686-1/lib/lablgtk2 -c ximage.mli
> File "ximage.mli", line 40, characters 16-31:
> Unbound type constructor Gdk.drawable
> make[1]: *** [ximage.cmi] Error 2

We have lablgtk version 2.12.0, if that needs to be known.

I'm surprised that this problem hasn't been reported to the Ant mailing
list before now - I've read through the titles of the mails, and can't
see any such report.

I'll press on tomorrow, but any idea how to get camlimages installed as
a prerequisite for Ant 0.8?

The current version of camlimages is 3.0.1:
http://gallium.inria.fr/camlimages/

That is what is installed on my Gentoo system, but I haven't yet tried
building ant with it.

Thanks, Barry - I'd bookmarked http://pauillac.inria.fr/camlimages/ -
which is still there, not updated since October 2004, and which still
has 2.2 current! It would appear that the problem I raised here was a
known bug at the time, that has long been fixed.

I'll install that and then try Ant 0.8.

Not wanting to keep track of versions myself is a major reason why I
switched from Slackware to Gentoo about five years ago. Instead of
packages, it's got a big database of software with instructions on how
to compile it. :)
