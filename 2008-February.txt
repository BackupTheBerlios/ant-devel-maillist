Hi.
I tried to compile ant on Debian sid and got an error not yet
discussed. I must mention that I set CAMLP4=camlp4r.opt (camlp4rf is
absent on my system). OCaml is 3.10.1, omake is 0.9.8.5.

Hi 

I encounter the same problem last time. And below is the answer from Achim :

--quote
ant is written in the revised syntax of ocaml. To compile it you need to
use a preprocessor (option "-pp camlp4rf").
--end quote

After installing camlp4rf, the compile runs fine.

When using camlp4r you need to load some additional modules.
Unfortunately, there is no documentation of camlp4r. According to some
website I found, you should use

  CAMLP4="camlp4r.opt -parser Camlp4QuotationExpander"

If that does not work, try to also add the options

  -parser Camlp4GrammarParser
  -parser Camlp4ListComprenhsion
  -parser Camlp4MacroParser

Thanks for reply!
I know (a bit) about revised syntax, and I thought that camlp4r (as
opposed to camlp4) uses just it. Finally I've found camlp4r in
camlp4-extra package, and it worked.

Subject: [ant-devel] improving ant during Google Summer of Code
Message-ID: <20080229092633.GA10352@home.ro-che.info>

Achim,

I really like ideas behind ant and believe that it can successfully
replace TeX.

Although you have done a lot, obviously it's hard for one man to compete
with wide community. And to make ant usable for almost every TeX user
there are still a lot of features and packages to be implemented.

Would you consider applying as a mentor for Google Summer of Code
programme[1]? This would give you developers who devote (at least) their
summer holidays to ant development. Particularly, I will be happy to
work on ant.

I could act as a mentor for GSoC, but only as part of some other
project. I won't submit an "ant project" since I don't think such a
project would have much chance of being accepted.

So, if there is some TeX related project willing to include work on ant,
I would volunteer as a mentor.

Supposing that there is such a project, which part of ant would you be
interested in working on?

Achim
