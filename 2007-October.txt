Hello,

I have recently been in need to do sofisticated graphics using TeX and I 
have been really disappointed in the way I could abstract over the data 
I wanted to draw.  I then looked for other ways of typesetting graphics 
in a tex fashion and found ANT which seems to be a really promising 
program.  I think that using ocaml as a script language is great, that 
it should allow straightforward graphics typesetting and really achieve 
this goal ANT has to be modular.  I got really interested in ANT until I 
realized that the last release was in late 2005.  So a natural question 
for me, before I spend time to learn how to use ANT, is whether ANT is 
still under development.  I do believe that if it is then it will 
eventually replace TeX as a typesetting program so that it will have 
earned a new early user.

Sylvain.

Note that the scripting language of ant is not OCaml. It's a language
resembling Haskell.

It is, and the next release doesn't seem to be that far off. But note
that progress is rather slow since I do not have that much time to spend
on it.
